Other\r\nplatforms may be added if time and resources permit.\r\n\r\nRecipes\r\n-------\r\n\r\n*sysrqd::default* - Decide if we are running on a supported system and,\r\nif so, run the correct driver recipe\r\n\r\nThe following *driver* recipes are currently supported:\r\n\r\n*sysrqd::ubuntu_10.04* - Installs and configures _sysrqd_ for Ubuntu\r\n10.04 LTS systems\r\n\r\n\r\nAttributes\r\n----------\r\n\r\n*[:sysrqd][:password]* - The password to use when authenticating to a\r\nnode running sysrqd. *NOTE* the password is sent in cleartext so should\r\nbe changed after use. There are better ways to secure this exchange and\r\nthey are left as an exercise to the reader (i.e., encrypted data bags,\r\nnoah, zookeeper, etc.)\r\n\r\n*[:sysrqd][:port]* - The port is stored on the node for informational\r\npurposes only (i.e. remembering which one it is on in the middle of the\r\nnight when you actually need to use sysrqd)\r\n\r\n*[:sysrqd][:commands]* - A list of standard commands keys used once\r\nauthenticated to sysrqd. This is stored for the same informational\r\npurposes as *[:sysrqd][:port]\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE AND AUTHOR\r\n==================\r\n\r\nAuthor:: Adam Garside (<adam.garside@gmail.com>)\r\n\r\nCopyright 2009-2012, Adam Garside\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in sysrqd with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n"}
